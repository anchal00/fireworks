# fireworks ðŸŽ‡
A crude attempt to simulate fireworks in Go.

### How to run
1. Clone and `cd` into the repo
2. Make sure you have Go installed.
3. Run `go run .`

Note: If you are not seeing the coloured characters being printed onto your terminal, make sure your terminal
supports ANSI 256-color scheme


### Why ?
Just for fun and teaching myself how to write Golang.
